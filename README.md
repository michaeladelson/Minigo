PRIVACY POLICY

Minígo uses Apple's Game Center service to enable users to play against friends or discover new players to play with.  In order to utilize Game Center, Minígo sends a minimal amount of data to Game Center when you play a turn. In particular, after each turn, the move history of the game and a unique identifier specific to Minígo that Game Center assigns to your Game Center account is sent to Game Center. Game Center will then pass this information to the other player so that the other player can be updated to the current state of the game. Minígo also displays your Game Center nickname to the other player. Any additional information that Apple stores when you use Game Center is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy.
